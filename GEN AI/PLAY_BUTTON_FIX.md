### 🎭 **NEW FEATURES ADDED:**

#### **⚡ Quick Test Button**

if (no audio) → Generate then Play
```

#### **Better Error Reporting**

- **Status messages** for each operation
- **Clear error descriptions** when things go wrong

### 🎪 **TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE:**

#### **If Quick Test Doesn't Work:**
1. **Check browser** - Use Chrome or Safari (best support)
2. **Check volume** - System and browser volume up
3. **Check permissions** - Allow audio in browser settings
4. **Try incognito mode** - Rule out extensions

#### **If Play Button Still Doesn't Work:**
1. **Try Quick Test first** - establishes basic audio works
2. **Check Debug Panel** - Click "🔍 Check System"
3. **Look at browser console** (F12) for error messages
4. **Try different voices** - Some voices work better than others

#### **If Audio Starts But Stops:**
1. **Close other audio apps** - Prevent conflicts
2. **Use the Stop button** before trying again
3. **Try shorter text** - Long text can cause timeouts
4. **Check system resources** - Audio needs CPU
